# Flask API Projects
A lightweight and modular RESTful API built using Python and Flask. This project serves as a backend foundation for web applications, supporting CRUD operations, JSON responses, and easy integration with frontend frameworks.

# Make sure you're in the directory where app.py is located, then follow these commands:
1. flask db init -	Run this once per project to initialize the migration setup. It creates the necessary folders and files to manage database migrations.
2. flask db migrate - Run this every time you modify the database schema â€” such as adding a new model class or changing fields in an existing one. It generates a migration script based on the changes.
3. flask db upgrade - Run this after each migration to apply the changes to your actual SQLite database.
